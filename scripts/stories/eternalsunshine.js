. 1 EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION - DAY 1
 It's gray. The platform is packed with business commuters:
 suits, overcoats. There is such a lack of color it almost
 seems as if it's a black and white shot, except one commuter
 holds a bright red heart-shaped box of candy under his arm.
 The platform across the tracks is empty. As an almost empty
 train pulls up to that platform, one of the suited men breaks
 out of the crowd, lurches up the stairs two at a time,
 hurries across the overpass and down the stairs to the other
 side, just at the empty train stops. The doors open and the
 man gets on that train. As the empty train pulls from the
 station, the man watches the crowd of commuters through the
 train's dirty window. We see his face for the first time.
 This is Joel Barish. He is in his 30's, sallow, a bit puffy.
 His hair is a little messy, his suit is either vintage or
 just old and dirty and sort of threadbare. His bright tie
 has a photograph of a rodeo printed on it.
2 EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION - DAY 2
 Joel talks on a payphone. The wind howls around him. He
 tries to shield the mouthpiece as he talks. His speech is a
 self-conscious mumble, especially difficult to hear over the
 elements.
 JOEL
 Hi, Cindy. It's Joel. Joel. I'm not
 feeling well this morning. No, food
 poisoning, I think. I had clams. Clams!
 I'm sorry it took me so long to call in,
 but I've been vomiting a lot. I've been
 vomiting! Yes, that's right, a lot!
3 EXT. BEACH - DAY 3
 Joel wanders the windy, empty beach, with his briefcase. He
 passes an old man with a metal detector. They nod at each
 other.
4 EXT. BEACH - DAY 4
 Later: Joel looks out at the ocean.
5 EXT. BEACH - DAY 5
 Later: Joel sits on a rock and pulls a big, tattered notebook
 from his briefcase. He opens it and reads his last entry.
 JOEL (V.O.)
 January 6, 2001. Nothing much. Naomi
 and I coexisting. Roommates. Nothing.
 Will it go on like this forever? My best
 guess? Yes.
 (CONTINUED) 
 Under the entry is a detailed drawing of a paranoid, wild-
 eyed man huddled in the corner of a damp basement lit by a
 bare bulb on a cord. Joel notices something odd: a great
 many pages have been torn out after the last entry. He
 ponders it for a moment, then writes on the next page:
 JOEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
 Valentine's Day 2003. First entry in two
 years. Where did those years go? If
 you're not careful it gets away from you.
 And then it's over and you're dead. And
 within a few years who even remembers you
 were here?
 (thinks)
 Called in sick today. Took the train out
 to Montauk.
 (thinks)
 Cold.
 (thinks some more)
 Don't know what else to say. I saw Naomi
 last night. First time since the break-
 up. We had sex. It was odd to fall into
 our old familiar sex life so easily.
 Like no time has passed. Suddenly we're
 talking about getting together again. I
 guess that's good.
 He has no other thoughts, does some work on the drawing on
 the opposite page. He glances up, spots a female figure in
 the distance, walking in his direction. She stands out
 against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded sweatshirt.
 This is Clementine. She's in her early thirties, zaftig. He
 watches her for a bit, then as she nears, he goes back to his
 drawing, or at least pretends to. Once she has passed, he
 watches her walk away. She stops and stares out at the
 ocean. Joel writes.
 JOEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
 Constitutionally incapable of making eye-
 contact with a woman I don't know. Guess
 I'd better get back with Naomi. Ought to
 buy her a Valentine. She loves roses, I
 believe.
6 EXT. BEACH - DAY 6
 LATER: Joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the
 season. He peeks cautiously in a dark window.
7 EXT. BEACH - DAY 7
 LATER: Joel digs into the sand with a stick. 
3.
8 INT. DINER - DAY 8
 It's a local tourist place, but off-season empty. An old
 couple drink coffee at the counter. Joel sits in a booth and
 eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of tomato soup. In
 his notebook he is drawing a wizened old man with a metal
 detector. His metal detector has led him to another dead old
 man clutching a metal detector. Joel meekly, unsuccessfully,
 tries to get the waitress's attention for more coffee.
 Clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood. Joel
 glances at her bright blue hair. She picks an empty booth
 and sits. Joel studies her discreetly. The waitress
 approaches her with a coffee pot.
 CLEMENTINE
 Hi, it's me again! My home away from
 home.
 WAITRESS
 Coffee?
 CLEMENTINE
 God, yes. You've saved my life! Brrr!
 The waitress pours the coffee.
 WAITRESS
 You know what you want?
 CLEMENTINE
 (laughing)
 Ain't that the question of the century.
 The waitress is not amused. Clementine gets business-like.
 CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
 You got grilled cheese and tomato soup
 again today?
 WAITRESS
 We're having a run on it.
 The waitress heads to the grill. Clementine fishes in her
 bag, brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment,
 pours something in, then brings the cup back up.
 CLEMENTINE
 (calling)
 And some cream, please.
 Clementine looks around the place. Her eyes meet Joel's
 before he is able to look away. She smiles vaguely. He
 looks embarrassed, then down at his journal.
 (CONTINUED) 
4.
8 CONTINUED: 8
 Clementine pulls a book from her purse and starts to read.
 Joel glances up, tries to see the book's cover. It's blue
 and white. He can't make out the title.
9 EXT. BEACH - DAY 9

 Joel stares out at the ocean. Far down the beach Clementine
 stares at it, too. Joel glances sideways at her then back at
 the ocean.
10 EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON 10
 Joel sits on a bench waiting for the train. Clementine
 enters the platform, sees Joel, the only other person there.
 She waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if
 they're old friends. He waves back, embarrassed. She takes
 a seat on a bench far down the platform. Joel stares at his
 hands, pulls his journal from his briefcase and tries to
 write in order to conceal his awkwardness.
 JOEL (V.O.)
 Why do I fall in love with every woman I
 see who shows me the least bit of
 attention?
11 INT. TRAIN - LATE AFTERNOON 11
 Joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the
 slowly passing desolate terrain. After a moment the door
 between cars opens and Clementine enters. Joel looks up.
 Clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding
 where to sit. She settles on a seat at the opposite end of
 the car. Joel looks out the window. He feels her watching
 him. The train is picking up speed. Finally:
 CLEMENTINE
 (calling over the rumble)
 Hi!
 Joel looks over.
 JOEL
 I'm sorry?
 CLEMENTINE
 What? I couldn't hear you.
 JOEL
 I said, I'm sorry.
 CLEMENTINE
 Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
 (CONTINUED) 
5.
11 CONTINUED: 11
 JOEL
 No, I didn't know if you were talking to
 me, so...
 She looks around the empty car.
 CLEMENTINE
 Really?
 JOEL
 (embarrassed)
 Well, I didn't want to assume.
 CLEMENTINE
 Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the
 leap and assume someone is talking to you
 in an otherwise empty car.
 JOEL
 Anyway. Sorry. Hi. Hello. Hi.
 Clementine giggles, makes her way down the aisle toward Joel.
 CLEMENTINE
 It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't
 have to scream? Not that I don't need to
 scream sometimes, believe you me.
 (pause)
 But I don't want to bug you if you're
 trying to write something.
 JOEL
 (mumbling)
 No, I'm just... I don't really, um ...
 CLEMENTINE
 What? You don't really what?
 She hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where she
 came from.
 JOEL
 It's okay if you want to sit down.
 CLEMENTINE
 Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe.
 I have a long trip ahead of me.
 (sits across aisle from Joel)
 How far are you going? On the train, I
 mean, of course. Not in life.
 JOEL
 Rockville Center.
 (CONTINUED) 
6.
11 CONTINUED: (2) 11
 CLEMENTINE
 Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
 She stares at him. He gets uncomfortable.
 CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
 Do I know you?
 JOEL
 I don't think so.
 CLEMENTINE
 Hmmmm. Do you ever shop at Barnes and
 Noble?
 JOEL
 Sure.
 CLEMENTINE
 That's it. That's me: book slave there
 for, like, five years now. I thought I'd
 seen you somewhere.
 JOEL
 Really? Because --
 CLEMENTINE
 Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit
 right now.
 JOEL
 -- I go there all the time. I think I'd
 remember you.
 CLEMENTINE
 Well, I'm there. I've seen you, man. I
 hide in the back as much as is humanly
 possible. You have a cell phone? I need
 to quit right this minute. I'll call in
 dead. I'll go on the dole like my daddy
 before me. Might be the hair.
 JOEL
 What might?
 CLEMENTINE
 Changes a lot. That's why you might not
 recognize me. What color am I today?
 (pulls a strand in front of her
 eyes, studies it)
 Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The
 color. Snappy name, huh?
 (CONTINUED) 
7.
11 CONTINUED: (3) 11
 JOEL
 I like it.
 CLEMENTINE
 Blue ruin is cheap gin, in case you're
 wondering.
 JOEL
 Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
 CLEMENTINE
 Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
 JOEL
 I can't remember.
 CLEMENTINE
 Anyway, this company makes a whole line
 of colors with equally snappy names. Red
 Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.
 That'd be a job, coming up with those
 names. How do you get a job like that?
 That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
 JOEL
 I don't really know how --
 CLEMENTINE
 Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
 JOEL
 You think that could possibly be a full-
 time job? How many hair colors could
 there be? Fifty, tops?
 CLEMENTINE
 (pissy)
 Somebody's got that job.
 (excited)
 Agent Orange! I came up with that one.
 Anyway, there are endless color
 possibilities and I'd be great at it.
 JOEL
 (mumbly)
 I'm sure you would.
 CLEMENTINE
 My writing career! Your hair written by
 Clementine Kruczynski. *
 (thought)
 The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
 (CONTINUED) 
8.
11 CONTINUED: (4) 11
 JOEL
 You sure? I don't know that album --
 CLEMENTINE
 I think. Anyway, I've tried all their
 colors. More than once. I'm getting too
 old for this. But it keeps me from
 having to develop an actual personality.
 I apply my personality in a paste. You?
 JOEL
 Oh, I doubt that's the case.
 CLEMENTINE
 Well, you don't know me, so... you don't
 know, do you?
 JOEL
 Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
 CLEMENTINE
 Yeah, I got it.
 There's a silence.
 CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
 My name's Clementine, by the way.
 JOEL
 I'm Joel.
 CLEMENTINE
 No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't
 do that; you're trying to be nice.
 JOEL
 I don't know any jokes about your name.
 CLEMENTINE
 Huckleberry Hound?
 JOEL
 I don't know what that means.
 CLEMENTINE
 Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
 JOEL
 It's been suggested.
 (CONTINUED) 
9.
11 CONTINUED: (5) 11
 CLEMENTINE
 (singing)
 "Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my
 darlin' Clementine"? No? Nothin'?
 JOEL
 Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It
 means "merciful", right? Clemency?
 CLEMENTINE
 (impressed)
 Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a
 vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
 JOEL
 See, I wouldn't think that about you.
 CLEMENTINE
 (pissy)
 Why wouldn't you think that about me?
 JOEL
 I don't know. I was just... I don't
 know. I was just... You seemed nice, so
 --
 CLEMENTINE
 Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other
 adjectives? There's careless and snotty
 and overbearing and argumentative...
 mumpish.
 JOEL
 (mumbling)
 Well, anyway... Sorry.
 They sit in silence for a while.
 CLEMENTINE
 I just don't think "nice" is a
 particularly interesting thing to be.
 The conductor enters the car.
 CONDUCTOR
 Tickets.
 Joel hands the conductor his ticket. The conductor punches
 it and hands it back.
 (CONTINUED) 
10.
11 CONTINUED: (6) 11
 CLEMENTINE
 What is nice, anyway? I mean, besides an
 adjective? I guess it can be an adverb,
 sort of.
 The conductor turns to Clementine. She fishes in her bag.
 CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
 It doesn't reveal anything. Nice is
 pandering. Cowardly. And life is more
 interesting than that. Or should be.
 Jesus God, I hope it is... someday.
 (to conductor)
 I know itís here.
 The conductor and Joel watch as she gets more agitated.
 CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
 I don't need nice. I don't need myself
 to be it and I don't need anyone else to
 be it at me.
 JOEL
 Okay, I understand.
 CLEMENTINE
 Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
 She dumps the contents of the bag onto the seat and sifts
 frantically through. Joel sees the book she was reading in
 the diner. It's The Red Right Hand by Joel Townsley Rogers.
 Joel eyes the book.
 CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
 Damn it. DAMN IT!
 (there it is)
 Oh. Here.
 She hands the conductor the ticket, smiles sweetly. He
 punches it, hands it back to her, and walks away.
 CONDUCTOR
 Next stop Southampton.
 The conductor heads into the next car. Clementine shoves
 stuff back into her purse. Her hands are a little shaky.
 She pulls an airline-sized bottle of alcohol from her pocket,
 opens it, and downs it. Joel is watching all of this but
 pretending not to. She looks out the window for a while.
 The train pulls into the station. The doors open. Nobody
 gets on. The doors close. The train pulls out.
 (CONTINUED) 
11.
11 CONTINUED: (7) 11
 CLEMENTINE
 Joel? It's Joel, right?
 JOEL
 Yes?
 CLEMENTINE
 I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it
 yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever,
 I'm a little out of sorts today.
 JOEL
 (trying for a joke)
 Hey, Old Yeller would be a good color.
 CLEMENTINE
 (not seeming to hear)
 My embarrassing admission is I really
 like that you're nice. Right now,
 anyway. I can't tell from one moment to
 the next what I'm going to like. But
 right now I'm glad you are.
 JOEL
 It's no problem. Anyway, I have some
 stuff I need to -- I'm trying to work out
 some -- I'm writing some thoughts, sort
 of.
 CLEMENTINE
 Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...
 (stands throws bag over
 shoulder)
 Take care, then.
 JOEL
 (pulling notebook from
 briefcase)
 Probably see you at the book store.
 CLEMENTINE
 (heading toward other end of
 car)
 Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
 Old Yeller is funny, by the way.
 Clementine sits and stares out the window.
 JOEL
 How about Karen Black?
 CLEMENTINE
 You're good! We could be partners.
 (CONTINUED) 
12.
11 CONTINUED: (8) 11
 They smile at each other. Joel drops the gaze first.
12 INT. TRAIN - DUSK 12
 There are a few more people in the car now. Clementine has
 inched a few seats closer to Joel. She watches him. His
 head is buried in his notebook. He's drawing Clementine.
13 INT. TRAIN - NIGHT 13
 It's dark out. The train is pretty crowded. A couple of
 women hold bouquets of flowers, another has a red heart-
 shaped box of candy. Joel stares out the window. Clementine
 sits closer still to Joel, eyes him.
14 EXT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT 14
 The doors open and Joel emerges along with others. He heads
 to the parking lot, arrives at his car. There's a big dented
 scrape along the driver's side.
15 INT./EXT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT 15
 MOMENTS LATER: Joel drives. He passes Clementine walking.
 She looks cold. He considers, slows, rolls down his window.
 JOEL
 Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
 CLEMENTINE
 No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
 JOEL
 You sure? It's cold.
 CLEMENTINE
 Yeah? It is frosty.
 He pulls over. She climbs in. They drive.
 JOEL
 Where do you live?
 CLEMENTINE
 You're not a stalker or anything, right?
 JOEL
 Stalker Channing. No, that's not really
 a color, is it? Quit while I'm ahead.
 CLEMENTINE
 You can't be too careful about stalkers.
 I've been stalked.
 (MORE)
 (CONTINUED) 
13.
15 CONTINUED: 15
 CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
 I've been told by experts I'm highly
 stalkable. I don't need that.
 JOEL
 I'm not a stalker. You talked to me,
 remember?
 CLEMENTINE
 That's the oldest trick in the stalker
 book.
 (beat)
 You know Sherman Drive?
 JOEL
 Yeah.
 CLEMENTINE
 Sherman Drive. Near the high school.
 Joel turns. They drive in silence.
 CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
 Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of
 nutso. I'm not really.
 JOEL
 That's okay. I didn't think you were.
 There's a silence. She broods.
 CLEMENTINE
 Well, I am. Okay?
 (pointing to a house)
 Me.
 Joel pulls over.
 CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
 Thanks very much. That was very nice of
 you.
 JOEL
 Oh, well, I wouldn't want to be nice --
 CLEMENTINE
 Jesus, I'm full of shit. I already told
 you that.
 (pause)
 Anyway. See ya. Happy Valentine's Day.
 He looks at her. Clementine opens the car door.
 JOEL
 You too. I enjoyed meeting you.
 (CONTINUED) 
14.
15 CONTINUED: (2) 15
 CLEMENTINE
 (turning back)
 Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have
 lots of drinks. And I could --
 JOEL
 Um --
 CLEMENTINE
 Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm
 embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
 16    INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        16       A FEW MINUTES LATER: Joel stands in the living room, somewhat       nervously.  He tries to calm himself by focusing on the       surroundings.  He looks at the books on her shelves.       Clementine is in the kitchen.  We see her as she passes by       the doorway several times, preparing drinks and chatting.                            CLEMENTINE                  Thanks!  I like it, too.  Been here about                  four years.  It's really cheap.  My                  downstairs neighbor is old so she's                  quiet, which is great.  And the                  landlord's sweet, which is bizarre, but                  great, and I have a little porch in the                  back, which is great, because I can read                  there, and listen to my crickets and...       Clementine is in the living room now with two gin and tonics.                            CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)                  Two blue ruins...       Joel is looking at a framed black and white photograph of       crows flying.                            CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)                  You like that?                            JOEL                  Very much.                            CLEMENTINE                  This... this guy gave that to me, just,                  like, recently.  I like it, too.  I like                  crows.  I think I used to be a crow.       She caws and hands Joel a drink.                                                       (CONTINUED)

Your                  caw is something to crow about.                            CLEMENTINE                  Huh?       Joel shakes his head embarrassedly and mumbles something.                            CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)                  Do you believe in that stuff?                  Reincarnation?                            JOEL                  I don't know.                            CLEMENTINE                  Me neither.  Oh, there's an inscription                  on the back.       Clementine takes the photo off the wall and shows Joel the       *       inscription on back.                                             *                            JOEL                  Frost?                            CLEMENTINE                      (impressed)                  Yeah.  I'm not, like, a Robert Frost                  lover by any stretch.  His stuff seems                  strictly grade school to me.  But this                  made me cry for some reason.  Maybe                  because it is grade school.  Y'know?                            JOEL                  It's pretty.                            CLEMENTINE                  I miss grade school.  I don't know why                  I'm calling it grade school all of a                  sudden.  When I went we called it                   elementary school.  But I like grade                  school better.  Sounds like something                  someone from the forties would call it.                  I'd like to be from then.  Everyone wore                  hats.  Anyway, cheers!                            JOEL                  Cheers.       They clink glasses.  Clementine giggles and takes a big gulp       of her drink.  Joel sips.  She plops down on the couch and       pulls her boots off.                                                       (CONTINUED)

Take                  yours off.                            JOEL                  I'm fine.                            CLEMENTINE                  Yeah?  Well, have a seat, anyway.       Joel sits in a chair across the room.  Clementine finishes       her drink.                            CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)                  Ready for another?                            JOEL                  No, I'm okay for now.       She heads toward the kitchen with her glass.                            CLEMENTINE                  Well, I'm ready.  Put some music on.       Joel crosses to the CD's and studies them.                            JOEL                  What do you want to hear?                            CLEMENTINE (O.S.)                  You pick it.                            JOEL                  You just say.  I'm not really --                            CLEMENTINE (O.S.)                  I don't know!  I can't see them from                  here, Joel!  Just pick something good.       Joel studies the unfamiliar CD's.  He picks up Bang On a Can       performing Brian Eno's Music for Airports to look at.       Clementine reenters with her drink.                            CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)                  Oh, excellent choice.       She grabs it and sticks it in the CD player.  The music is       dreamy and haunting and slow.  Clementine falls back onto the       couch, closes her eyes and sips her drink.                            CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)                  Mmmmmmm.  Way to go, Joel.  You pick                  good.                                                       (CONTINUED)                                                      
17. 16    CONTINUED: (3)                                             16       Joel sits down in his chair and drinks.  There's a silence,       which seems fine to Clementine but makes Joel anxious.                            JOEL                  Well, I should probably get going.                            CLEMENTINE                  No, stay.  Just for a little while.                      (opens her eyes, brightly)                  Refill?                            JOEL                  No, I sort of have to go and --                            CLEMENTINE                  Stop mumbling.       She grabs Joel's drink from his hand, takes it into the       kitchen.                            CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D)                  God bless alcohol, is what I say.  Where                  would I be without it.  Jesus, Mary, and                  Joseph, maybe I don't want to think about                  that.       She giggles.  Joel looks around the room again.  There are       several potatoes dressed as women in beautiful handmade       costumes: a nurse potato, a stripper potato, a schoolteacher       potato, a housewife potato.  He stares at the potatoes,       confused.  Clementine returns with Joel's drink and a refill        for herself.                            JOEL                  Thanks.                            CLEMENTINE                  Drink up, young man.  It'll make the                  whole seduction part less repugnant.       Joel looks a little alarmed. `
